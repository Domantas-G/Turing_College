translate business requirements into data engineering tasks

1. Database Access for Data Analysts:
   User Story: As a data analyst, I want to have convenient access to the initial data so that I can query and analyze it using ad-hoc SQL queries.

Data Engineering Tasks:

Database Setup: Choose a suitable database system (RDBMS like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a cloud-based solution depending on the data scale and infrastructure preference).
Data Ingestion: Migrate the initial data into the chosen database. This might involve ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes if the data is in raw or unstructured formats.
Schema Design: Design a database schema that effectively represents the data, ensuring it's optimized for the types of queries analysts will run.
Access Control: Set up user roles and permissions to ensure data security and integrity while allowing analysts to run queries.
Provide Tools & Documentation: Equip data analysts with SQL querying tools and provide documentation on the database schema, sample queries, and best practices. 2. Python API for Data Scientists (Read Access):
User Story: As a data scientist, I want to have access to the data through a Python API using SQL queries so that my simulation engine can get data.

Data Engineering Tasks:

API Design & Development: Develop a Python-based API that interfaces with the database, allowing data retrieval.
Optimized Querying: Ensure that the API supports efficient querying, possibly through optimized SQL statements or database indexing.
Data Serialization: Implement methods to serialize the data for transmission, possibly using formats like JSON.
API Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation on how to use the API, including endpoints, request formats, and sample queries.
Testing & Deployment: Test the API for performance, security, and reliability. Deploy it in an environment accessible to data scientists. 3. Python API for Data Scientists (Write Access):
User Story: As a data scientist, I want to be able to write to the database using a Python API using SQL so that my simulation engine can write their predictions.

Data Engineering Tasks:

API Endpoints for Writing: Extend the API to include endpoints that allow data writing operations.
Data Validation: Implement validation checks to ensure that incoming data adheres to the expected format and constraints.
Concurrency Management: Ensure the API handles concurrent write operations, possibly through transaction management to maintain data integrity.
Backup & Recovery: Set up backup mechanisms to recover data in case of unintended overwrites or deletions.
Monitoring & Logging: Implement logging for all write operations to monitor and audit changes made to the database.

Normalized tables:
We'll aim for the Third Normal Form (3NF) as it usually provides a level of normalization that is sufficient for most applications, balancing the goals of reducing redundancy and ensuring data integrity.

1. raw_titles.csv:
   Current Structure:
   id (unique identifier for the title)
   title
   type (movie or show)
   release_year
   age_certification
   runtime
   genres
   production_countries
   seasons
   imdb_id
   imdb_score
   imdb_votes

Normalization:

titles Table:
title_id (Primary Key)
title
release_year
age_certification
runtime
imdb_id
imdb_score
imdb_votes
is_best_movie_by_year
is_best_movie
is_best_show_by_year
is_best_show

title_type Table:
title_id (Foreign Key)
type

title_genres Table:
genre_id (Primary Key)
title_id (Foreign Key)
genre

title_production_countries Table:
production_id (Primary Key)
title_id (Foreign Key)
country

2. raw_credits.csv:
   Current Structure:
   person_id
   id (title_id)
   name
   character
   role

Normalization:

persons Table:
person_id (Primary Key)
name

credits Table:
credit_id (Primary Key)
title_id (Foreign Key)
person_id (Foreign Key)
character
role

For tables:
'Best Movie by Year Netflix.csv',
'Best Movies Netflix.csv',
'Best Show by Year Netflix.csv',
'Best Shows Netflix.csv'

Integration Strategy:
Given the normalization strategy we followed for the primary dataset (raw_titles.csv), we can integrate these datasets as follows:

Linking with Primary Data:

Use the title and release year to match entries in the "Best Movie/Show by Year" datasets with the normalized titles table.
For the "Best Movies" and "Best Shows" datasets, use the title alone or in combination with other attributes to establish a link.
Create Additional Tables/Flags:

Flagging: Add a flag or column in the titles table to indicate if a particular movie/show is in the "best" list.
Separate Tables: Alternatively, create separate tables for "Best Movies" and "Best Shows", linking them with the primary titles table using foreign keys.
Data Consistency Checks:

Ensure that the titles in the "best" datasets match the titles in the primary dataset to maintain data consistency. Handle any discrepancies or mismatches.

The "Best Movie by Year", "Best Movies", "Best Show by Year", and "Best Shows" datasets provide specific subsets of the entire collection based on certain criteria. Here's how each can be utilized or integrated:

Best Movie by Year Netflix.csv:

Purpose: This dataset lists the best movie for each year based on IMDb score and the number of votes.
Potential Usage:
Trend Analysis: Understand trends in movie preferences over the years.
Recommendation Highlight: Feature these movies in a "Best Movie of the Year" section on the platform.
Best Movies Netflix.csv:

Purpose: This dataset lists movies that meet a specific criterion, i.e., a minimum IMDb score and a minimum number of votes.
Potential Usage:
Recommendation Engine: Prioritize these movies in recommendations for users who prefer highly-rated content.
Promotion: Use this list for promotional activities, highlighting these movies as the best on the platform.
Best Show by Year Netflix.csv:

Purpose: This dataset lists the best TV show for each year based on IMDb score and the number of votes.
Potential Usage:
Trend Analysis: Gain insights into which TV shows were popular in which year.
Recommendation Highlight: Feature these shows in a "Best Show of the Year" section on the platform.
Best Shows Netflix.csv:

Purpose: This dataset lists TV shows that meet a specific criterion, i.e., a minimum IMDb score and a minimum number of votes.
Potential Usage:
Recommendation Engine: Prioritize these shows in recommendations, especially for users who lean towards high-quality TV series.
Promotion: Promote these TV shows as the platform's top content.
