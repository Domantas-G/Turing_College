Plan

1. Data Acquisition:
   Select a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve hourly weather data.
   Use Python to periodically query the API for the 20 largest cities in Europe.
   Since the API calls need to be made concurrently, we can use asyncio (co-routines) to fetch data for multiple cities simultaneously.
2. Database Setup:
   Choose an RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing the weather data.
   Design a schema to store the city, country, timestamp, temperature, and weather condition.
3. Data Insertion:
   Use Python to insert the fetched data into the database.
4. Data Analysis:
   Create SQL views or queries to:
   Compute max, min, and standard deviation of temperatures per country and city for today, yesterday, current week, and last seven days.
   Identify the cities with the highest or lowest temperature for each hour, day, and week.
   Count the number of times it rained in the last day and week.
5. Scheduling:
   Set up cron jobs to:
   Periodically fetch and store data from the weather API.
   Run the analysis queries as required.
6. Scalability:
   Ensure that the code and database schema are designed in a way that they can easily accommodate an increasing number of cities.
7. Validation:
   Compare the fetched data with the simulator's predictions for validation.
8. Improvements and Insights:
   Provide insights on potential improvements in data acquisition, storage, and analysis.
   Implementation Details
9. Data Acquisition:
   Use Python's asyncio library to make concurrent API calls to fetch data for multiple cities.
   Justification: Asyncio is lightweight, efficient, and suitable for IO-bound tasks like API calls.

10. Edit the Crontab:
    Open the crontab file for editing using the crontab -e command. Once inside, you can add your tasks.

11. Setup Cron Jobs:
    a. Fetch and Store Data:
    Let's assume you have a Python script named fetch_and_store_data.py that fetches the weather data and stores it in the database. To run this script every hour, add the following line to your crontab file:
    0 \* \* \* \* /path/to/python3 /path/to/fetch_and_store_data.py

This means: at minute 0 of every hour of every day of every month, execute the Python script.

b. Run Analysis Queries:
Suppose you have another Python script run_analysis.py that executes the SQL queries for the data analysis. Depending on the frequency you want to run the analysis, you can add a corresponding line in the crontab file.

Every Hour:
0 \* \* \* _ /path/to/python3 /path/to/run_analysis.py
Every Day at Midnight:
0 0 _ \* \* /path/to/python3 /path/to/run_analysis.py

Every Week on Sunday at Midnight:
0 0 \* \* 0 /path/to/python3 /path/to/run_analysis.py

5. Logging (Optional):
   To keep track of the cron jobs, you can redirect the output (stdout and stderr) to log files:
   0 \* \* \* _ /path/to/python3 /path/to/fetch_and_store_data.py >> /path/to/log/fetch_data.log 2>&1
   0 0 _ \* \* /path/to/python3 /path/to/run_analysis.py >> /path/to/log/analysis.log 2>&1
