Such a loop will repeat a block of code over and over again.

"""For Loops
To best understand a for loop, itâ€™s best to begin by talking about a new variable type called a list in Python. As in other areas of our lives, we can have a grocery list, a to-do list, etc.
A for loop iterates through a list of items. For example, in the text editor window, modify your cat.py code as follows:
"""
# for i in [0, 1, 2]:
for i in range(3):
    print("meow")

n = 5
while True:
    n = int(input("What's n? "))
    if n < 0:
        break


def main():
    number = get_number()
    meow(number)


def get_number():
    while True:
        n = int(input("What's n? "))
        if n > 0:
            break
    return n


def meow(n):
    for _ in range(n):
        print("meow")


main()
